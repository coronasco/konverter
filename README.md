## Description

**Konverter** is a modern, fast, and free tool for converting and optimizing SVG files. You can upload or paste SVG code and instantly get:
- CSS with URL-encoded SVG
- CSS with Base64 SVG
- Functional React/JSX component
- Optimized SVG (smaller size, no useless metadata)

All with a modern interface, dark mode, drag & drop, live preview, and copy-to-clipboard!

## ‚ú® Motivation

SVGs are essential for the modern web, but:
- They are often too large, full of useless metadata
- You need to use them quickly as CSS backgrounds, inline images, or React components

**Konverter** was created to solve these problems, offering a fast, intuitive, and completely free experience for developers and designers.
